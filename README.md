# Colorful Trees

## A Minecraft resource pack that tweaks trees.

Colorful Trees aims to bring a bit more variety to your Minecraft world without bringing too much changes - as a matter of fact there's only one change, and it's about the color of the tree leaves.

Two types of trees are concerned.

### Birch
_Betula alleghaniensis_, also known as "Golden birch", is the reason behind birch leaves turning yellow here. This will make bitch forests a little more fun to explore and give a utility to birch leaves.

### Acacia
Acacia leaves becoming red doesn't make any real sense, but it matches the Savanna ambience well and will highlight the dryness of this biome.
